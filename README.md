# Chat-application
## Project goal Scope: 
#### To create a chat application using P2P structure, where the communication happened via UDP protocol. Show the program running in a GUI, where all messages sent are seen.

## Solution 
#### The server was made in python using the socket library, then two clients where connected to the server. It is important to mention that once the clients where talking, if they sent messages at least every 3min, there was no need to have the main server running. At the end a GUI was made with python framework PAGE
